# Implement-map-on-a-Prototype
Write your own Array.prototype.myMap()
Write your own Array.prototype.myMap(), which should behave exactly like Array.prototype.map(). You should not use the built-in map method. The Array instance can be accessed in the myMap method using this.
It is recommended you use a for loop or Array.prototype.forEach().
